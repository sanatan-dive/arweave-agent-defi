==================================================================== ðŸŽ¬ 2-3 MINUTE DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT AO DeFi Portfolio Manager Agent - Hackathon Submission
TIMING: 2:00-3:00 minutes total
VISUALS: Screen recording + voiceover
GOAL: Showcase autonomous DeFi agent for AO Hackathon judges

==================================================================== SECTION 1: HOOK & INTRODUCTION (0:00-0:30) - 30 seconds
[VISUAL: Open browser to ao.link] URL: https://www.ao.link/#/entity/3cn7HC83zWIzBnnHJlloZaLONq4uerfGRM-3OSR7gBs

SCRIPT: "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is my AO Hackathon submission: an autonomous DeFi portfolio manager running 24/7 on AO mainnet. This agent is production-ready, with over 2,000 lines of code, and it automatically manages, rebalances, and optimizes DeFi portfolios using real protocols. What you're seeing is a live agent on AO right now."

[VISUAL: Show the live agent on ao.link, highlight the process ID]

==================================================================== SECTION 2: PROBLEM & SOLUTION (0:30-1:00) - 30 seconds
[VISUAL: Switch to GitHub repository README] URL: https://github.com/sanatan-dive/arweave-agent-defi

SCRIPT: "DeFi portfolio management is complex and time-consuming. Users must monitor yields, rebalance assets, and manage risk across many protocols. My agent solves this by running autonomously on AO, integrating with real protocols like 0rbit Oracle for price feeds, Permaswap for trading, and AstroUSD for stable asset management. It uses machine learning and cryptographic randomness for smarter, safer decisions."

[VISUAL: Scroll through README showing architecture diagram and features]

==================================================================== SECTION 3: LIVE DEMO (1:00-2:00) - 60 seconds
[VISUAL: Switch to AOS terminal]

SCRIPT WHILE TYPING: "Let's see the agent in action. I'll load the demo module and show the available features."

COMMANDS TO TYPE:

.load demo.lua
run_demo()
NARRATION DURING MENU OUTPUT: "The agent provides a professional menu of features. You can run any demo function directly, for example: demo_portfolio(), demo_risk(), demo_ai(), demo_randomness(), demo_system(), quick_status(). Each function demonstrates a specific capability, from portfolio management to AI-powered analytics and MEV-resistant randomness."

[VISUAL: Show the menu output, then run a few demo functions individually:] 3. demo_portfolio() 4. demo_ai() 5. demo_randomness()

NARRATION: "Here you see the agent managing a live portfolio, performing risk assessments, and optimizing yields. The AI integration enables machine learning-powered risk and yield analysis, while the RandAO module provides cryptographic randomness for MEV protection. All features are modular and can be demonstrated individually."

[VISUAL: Show the output of each function, highlight key metrics and status lines]

==================================================================== SECTION 4: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (2:00-2:30) - 30 seconds
[VISUAL: Quick cuts between code files] Show: portfolio.lua, risk.lua, yield.lua

SCRIPT: "Technically, this agent features machine learning-based risk assessment, autonomous yield optimization, and smart rebalancing with slippage protection. Sponsor integrations include RandAO for MEV-resistant trading, Apus Network for AI-powered decisions, and AstroUSD for stable asset management. AO's message-passing architecture enables true decentralized autonomy."

[VISUAL: Briefly show code snippets from key functions like Risk.assess(), Portfolio.calculate_metrics()]

==================================================================== SECTION 5: IMPACT & CONCLUSION (2:30-3:00) - 30 seconds
[VISUAL: Back to ao.link showing live agent + GitHub repository side by side]

SCRIPT: "This is the future of DeFi: autonomous agents that manage portfolios 24/7, optimize yields, and protect against risk. It's live on AO mainnet, open source, and ready for real-world use. Thank you for watching."
