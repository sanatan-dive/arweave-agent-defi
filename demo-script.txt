ðŸŽ¬ 3-MINUTE DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT
AO DeFi Portfolio Manager Agent - Hackathon Submission
====================================================================

TIMING: 3:00 minutes total
VISUALS: Screen recording + voiceover
GOAL: Showcase autonomous DeFi agent for AO Hackathon judges

====================================================================
SECTION 1: HOOK & INTRODUCTION (0:00-0:30) - 30 seconds
====================================================================

[VISUAL: Open browser to ao.link]
URL: https://www.ao.link/#/entity/3cn7HC83zWIzBnnHJlloZaLONq4uerfGRM-3OSR7gBs

SCRIPT:
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I've built something revolutionary for the AO Hackathon - an autonomous DeFi portfolio manager that runs 24/7 on AO mainnet. This isn't just a demo - it's a production-ready agent with over 2,000 lines of code that automatically rebalances portfolios, optimizes yields, and manages risk across multiple protocols. You're looking at it live right now on the AO network."

[VISUAL: Show the live agent on ao.link, highlight the process ID]

TIMING: Speak clearly and confidently, 30 seconds exactly

====================================================================
SECTION 2: PROBLEM & SOLUTION (0:30-1:00) - 30 seconds  
====================================================================

[VISUAL: Switch to GitHub repository README]
URL: https://github.com/sanatan-dive/arweave-agent-defi

SCRIPT:
"DeFi portfolio management is incredibly complex. Users need to constantly monitor yields across dozens of protocols, rebalance based on changing risk profiles, and optimize returns while protecting against volatility. Most people simply can't do this manually. My agent solves this by running autonomously on AO's decentralized network, integrating with real protocols like 0rbit Oracle for price feeds, Permaswap for trading, and AstroUSD for stable asset management."

[VISUAL: Scroll through README showing architecture diagram and features]

TIMING: Emphasize "real protocols" and "autonomous"

====================================================================
SECTION 3: LIVE DEMO (1:00-2:00) - 60 seconds
====================================================================

[VISUAL: Switch to AOS terminal]

SCRIPT WHILE TYPING:
"Let me show you the agent in action. Here's my live agent running on AO mainnet..."

COMMANDS TO TYPE:
1. .load demo.lua
2. run_demo()
3. run_enhanced_demo()

NARRATION DURING DEMO OUTPUT:
"As you can see, the agent is fully initialized and connected to live protocols. It's managing a real portfolio, performing risk assessments using Value-at-Risk calculations, and optimizing yields across multiple protocols. Now let me show you the sponsor bonus features..."

NARRATION DURING ENHANCED DEMO:
"Here are the advanced features that make this agent truly cutting-edge. First, RandAO integration provides randomness for MEV-resistant rebalancing - notice how it requests randomness to prevent predictable trading patterns. Second, Apus Network AI integration enables machine learning-powered risk assessment and yield optimization. The agent makes real AI inference calls to enhance decision-making."

COMMAND TO TYPE:
4. Send({Target = ao.id, Action = "Portfolio-Status"})

NARRATION:
"The agent responds immediately, demonstrating true autonomous operation. It's continuously monitoring portfolio performance, assessing risk with machine learning algorithms, and ready to execute trades when thresholds are met."

[VISUAL: Show the message response and portfolio calculations scrolling]

TIMING: Let the demo output show for 5-10 seconds, then continue narration

====================================================================
SECTION 4: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (2:00-2:30) - 30 seconds
====================================================================

[VISUAL: Quick cuts between code files]
Show: portfolio.lua, risk.lua, yield.lua

SCRIPT:
"Under the hood, this agent features machine learning-based risk assessment with 95% confidence Value-at-Risk calculations, autonomous yield optimization that scans multiple protocols for the best returns, and smart rebalancing with slippage protection. But what makes it truly innovative are the sponsor integrations: RandAO provides cryptographic randomness for MEV-resistant trading, Apus Network enables real AI inference calls for enhanced decision-making, and AstroUSD integration offers stable asset management. It leverages AO's unique message-passing architecture for true decentralized autonomy."

[VISUAL: Briefly show code snippets from key functions like Risk.assess(), Portfolio.calculate_metrics()]

TIMING: Speak technically but clearly - emphasize sophistication

====================================================================
SECTION 5: IMPACT & CONCLUSION (2:30-3:00) - 30 seconds
====================================================================

[VISUAL: Back to ao.link showing live agent + GitHub repository side by side]

SCRIPT:
"This represents the future of DeFi - set your parameters once, and your portfolio is managed 24/7 by an autonomous agent that never sleeps, never misses opportunities, and continuously optimizes for your goals. It's deployed live on AO mainnet, fully open source, and ready for real-world use. The AO platform enables truly autonomous agents that run forever on the permaweb, and this portfolio manager showcases that potential perfectly. Thank you for watching."
